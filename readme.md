# Super Simple React Redux Starter with Authentication

My Super Simple React Redux starter project. Based off the guts of Wes Bos' [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) project.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:9000> in your browser.

Spoiler alert. Nothing happens yet.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.

### Todos
* Clean up
* add basic styling (make it pretty)
